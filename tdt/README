As our project has reached puberty we decided that it is time to release it to the world
by taking it somewhere more public.

For that we have created a git repository with the most important parts of our project the
* build environment,
* kernel sources(patches),
* all tdt applications,
* enigma2 source,
* drivers sources.

What this package does not contain is/are :
* any proprietary video and audio firmwares + headers
* the proprietary pti driver, but we replaced this with an limited open source version.

This Packets does not contain any proprietary stuff and is therefor completely legal.

This git repository will soon (later this day) be available for you for cloning, but this will be only for a limited time, max 1 week.
We hope that you will put it to good use, hopefully you will clone it to an open source git hoster like gitorious or github.

All this means of course that Team Ducktales won't be Team Ducktales as we know an love it any longer,
but we are sure that the era of sh4 based settopboxes featuring enigma2, neutrino and vdr has just began.
