  If VDR is patched with <=Extensions-Patch-43, it is required to
  apply the patch to VDR included with the plugin.
  After this just copy your vdr-menu.xml to vdr-menu.OSDLanguage.xml
  OSDLanguage must be named like in VDRs setup.conf
  example ( vdr >=1.5.7 )
    OSDLanguage=de_DE  ->    vdr-menu.de_DE.xml
  example ( vdr <1.5.7 )
    OSDLanguage=1      ->    vdr-menu.1.xml
  for default VDR uses vdr-menu.xml
